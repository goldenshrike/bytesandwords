    <div class="reflection">This picture was taken at the Tech Assistant workstation, 
		with Kris Hardy, one of my supervisors.  It is located in the Work Study room, 
		and is is where I do all my work.</div>

	<div class="reflection">Much of what I did in the first weeks of my internship 
		was completing tutorials on websites like <a href="codecademy.com" 
		style="text-decoration: none; color: cornflowerblue">Codecademy</a>.  
		In order to function as a Tech Assistant in a web development office, 
		I needed to brush up my knowledge of HTML and actually learn CSS. 
		I found that tutorials from Codecademy are very good for beginners, 
		and to the left is a screenshot of one of the lessons, in which I made a 
		"social networking" page for my favorite literary character.</div>
		<div class="screenshot"><img src="Wireframe_Example.jpg" 
			 alt="A blank wireframe for a page in the Jadu CMS" /></div>
		<div class="reflection">One of my main tasks is to migrate pages from Messiah's 
			existing website to the content management system Jadu.  This is a blank 
			wireframe for a page in the Philosophy department's website. In the beginning, 
			I was not asked to do any large projects, obviously, and so my work was mostly 
			made up of copy editing and building sites that would eventually get content. 
			As I grew more comfortable in my job, I was tasked with migrating entire 
			department websites.</div>
		<div class="screenshot"><img src="XForm_Example.jpg" alt="A screenshot of an Xform" />
		</div>
		<div class="reflection">I have had to make a number of special pages called Xforms 
			during my internship experience. Xforms are like normal HTML forms, except that they 
			have the capability to branch into different paths depending on selections that the 
			user makes. This eliminates the need of having unnecessary questions on a form; if the 
			form is meant for a diverse audience and not all questions will be relevant to everyone 
			filling it out, it can skip unecessary questions based on the information that the user 
			enters into the form.  The example I have given does not have any branching paths, but 
			if it did, the structure would reflect the amount of choice paths the user could take.

		<div class="screenshot"><img src="Basecamp_Example.jpg" alt="A screenshot from Basecamp" />
		</div>
		<div class="reflection">Towards the end of October, 2013, we started using a project 
			management application called Basecamp to manage large projects.  The big project for 
			November that I got to take part in was the creation of new academic offerings pages.  
			My first task was to build almost eighty wireframes for many concentrations and minors 
			that the college offers, and locate the course requirement information for each one.  
			For each of these, I was asked to make a discussion thread in Basecamp and post the 
			links to the wireframe website and the course requirement PDF, which the staff writers 
			could use as a place to post the content that was to go in the new page.</div>
